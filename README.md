# fonne_arduino_animation
Some arduino code to animate fonne fieste

This code was written in summer 2019 to get some automation in the bar at the Fonne feesten festival

We are using a motor with a control unit, this motor is used to turn a prison guard in a watchtower from left to right.

The control unit has 3 buttons:
 - turn left
 - stop
 - turn right
 
We used a arduino mega + an 8 channel relay board to automate the buttons, 3 relays were used to activate these buttons.

The fourth relay is used to periodically start a stroboscoop to light up the elect chair ornament.
