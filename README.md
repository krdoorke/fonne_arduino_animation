Some arduino code to animate the fonne feesten "bar 2"

This code was written in summer 2019 to get some automation in the bar at the Fonne feesten festival.

We are using a motor with a control unit (Multifix Mel 4000), this motor is used to turn an armed prison guard in a watchtower from left to right.

The control unit has 3 buttons:
 - turn left
 - stop
 - turn right
 
We used a arduino mega + an 8 channel relay board to automate the buttons, 3 relays were used to activate these buttons.

The fourth relay is used to periodically start a stroboscoop to light up the electric chair ornament.
